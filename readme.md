One large issue in the development of event-driven applications was that Java particularly had no means of determining as to what functionality type should actually be called in some singular method, and the only way to reasonably type behaviors was through an execution-logic interface, such as _Runnable_. This made it a pain to actually develop event-driven applications, because there was a need to implement some execution-logic, that was expected to be executed. Also, by almost no means other than adding further complexity, such as a "should execute" function, could a running environment actually determine whether or not the logicality should be executed. On top of that, there was an inability to encapsulate state to event objects, because the underlying implementation is hidden by the overlying interface. In Java 5 came _annotations_, which allowed the configuration, or marking, of functions, that could be accessed through both run-time and source scanning.

We realized the issue of creating event-driven applications, so we made the **EoD** event library. With our library, you gain the benefits of event-driven programming in a natural way.
